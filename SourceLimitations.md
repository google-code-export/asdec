# Source limitations #

At the moment, the decompiler cannot show source of "crypted" SWF files.

SWF files modified by programs like secureSWF, SWF Encrypt etc. cannot be successfully decompiled to show source code.

(Program will show some Exceptions in the place where source code should be)

For ActionScript 1/2 in some cases of encryption you cannot even show P-code.

For ActionScript 3 you **can view and edit P-code** (assembler) freely even if is "crypted".
